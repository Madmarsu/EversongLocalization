Localization Files for the App Eversong - <http://parkbench.eu/eversong/>

Feel free to contribute to the localization of Eversong. For each language the most current localization files are in a subfolder called "<languageCode>.lproj". To provide the translation for a new language, start by creating a copy of the English folder (en.lproj). All the files within this folder must be translated into the new language.

When you are finished feel free to commit or send the zipped folder to <eversong@parkbench.eu>.
